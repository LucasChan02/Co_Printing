# E0 Stepper Motor Pins (from generic-ramps.cfg for ATmega2560)
step_pin: PA4      # Corresponds to E0_STEP on RAMPS
dir_pin:!PA6      # Corresponds to E0_DIR on RAMPS. Add '!' to invert if needed.
enable_pin:!PA2   # Corresponds to E0_ENABLE on RAMPS. Add '!' to invert if needed.

microsteps: 16     # Common for A4988/DRV8825 drivers on RAMPS.
rotation_distance: 31.68
# This is CRITICAL. It's the mm of filament extruded per full stepper motor rotation.
# Example starting points: 33.500 (from generic-ramps.cfg [18]) or 7.711 (from another example [19]).
# MUST BE CALIBRATED for your specific extruder, gear ratio, and hobbed gear.
# Klipper docs explain calibration: measure filament, adjust, repeat.

# This is a common thermistor type. Verify for your specific hotend.

# See Klipper documentation for a list of supported sensor_types.[20]

max_temp: 220            # Maximum safe operating temperature
min_extrude_temp: 190    # Safety feature: Klipper will not extrude if temperature is below this.

# Optional but Recommended: Pressure Advance for improved print quality.[1, 3]
# pressure_advance: 0.0  # Start with 0.0 and calibrate using Klipper's tuning guide.
# pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.040 # Default, usually okay.

# Retraction settings can be controlled by G-code from ROS (e.g., G10/G11 if supported by Klipper setup,
# or by sending explicit G1 E- moves). Klipper can also manage retraction if configured here
# and invoked by G20/G21 (requires [firmware_retraction] section).
# For robotic printing, ROS might handle retraction logic by sending specific G1 E commands.
